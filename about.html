            <p>The Business Model Competition represents the&nbsp;ground breaking approach to entrepreneurship that focuses on the process of improving the inputs into entrepreneurship rather than the outputs.Rather than focusing on outputs like business plans or fundraising,
              this new approach focuses on the key tasks of testing assumptions in the field and developing validated business models which is usually manifest&nbsp;through deep customer interaction and traction.</p>
            <p>
              <br>The business model competition at LPU would act as platform in bringing together&nbsp;entrepreneurial service providers,&nbsp;seasoned entrepreneurs&nbsp;and supporters of startups to accelerate&nbsp;&nbsp;the growth of sustainable new businesses and
              local entrepreneurial ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Business Model Competition would reward&nbsp;students for:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>breaking down their idea into key assumptions (aspects of the company's business model),</li>
              <li>getting outside the building and testing these assumptions with the customers</li>
              <li>applying customer development and lean startup practices to make sure they fully understand the pain and solution, and,learning to pivot until they have arrived at a customer-validated business model.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u><strong>WHAT DO WINNING TEAMS DO?</strong></u>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here is a condensed work plan for what a team actually does to have a chance of winning&nbsp;the BMC. These are not formulas for success but illustrations of how forging ahead with a business model should be different from writing a business plan.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Business Model Development&nbsp;(based on, Steve Blank’s Customer Development&nbsp;process/course,&nbsp;Alexander Osterwalder’s&nbsp;Business Model Canvas)</li>
              <li>Find a Problem:&nbsp;Find a big customer problem worth solving and write down all your key hypothe-ses about the business model to solve this problem.We recommend that you use Alex Osterwalder’s&nbsp;Business Model Canvas as a scorecard to track your&nbsp;assumptions
                and the changes that&nbsp;you make.</li>
              <li>Nail the Pain:&nbsp;Get outside the building and inter-view customers face-to-face to understand the “job”customers are trying to do, their current pain, and&nbsp;how they solve that pain. Pivot when you discover&nbsp;you are wrong.</li>
              <li>Nail the Solution:&nbsp;Develop a minimum viable prod-uct prototype and get outside the building face-to-face with customers to test your vision of the solution. Pivot when you discover you are wrong. Re-&nbsp;peat these tests until you nail&nbsp;the
                solution.4.</li>
              <li>Nail the Go-to-Market Strategy:&nbsp;Get outside the&nbsp;building to understand the end-to-end customer buy-ing process, the market communication infrastructure, the distribution infrastructure. Identify the lev-erage points. Pivot.5.</li>
              <li>Nail the Business Model:&nbsp;Use the facts discovered&nbsp;to validate the revenue model for the business.6.</li>
              <li>Pivot:&nbsp;Throughout the process learn to change course whenever you discover you are&nbsp;wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whichever particular method you use, the key steps are to 1)identify your assumptions, 2) get outside the building to test those assumptions, 3) validate the facts with customers and pivot as needed, and 4) identify lessons learned.</p>
            <p>For the competition, you will tell us about the process you went through,revealing the dead ends and surprises that you discovered along the way. Remember, the goal is validated learning about the business model assumptions and failing early is a success
              compared to failing late. If you fail but have a compelling story, submit any way—you may get the award!Your final submission for the competition will be a narrated multimedia presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, etc.) saved as a video file and uploaded
              to YouTube&nbsp;that tells your story. Remember that rather than focusing on a business plan or trying to sell your idea, your presentation needs to focus on telling the story of how you tested your unexamined assumptions in the field and developed a
              validated business model. You will manifest this by demonstrating a deep understanding of customers and revealing the details of how you may have discovered that some of your assumptions were wrong and how you changed accordingly.</p>
